				<h3 class="fontface">Why do I need an advisor to sell my company?</h3> There are a number of reasons you would want to 
				hire professional advisors to help with your transaction. The following video gives a great overview as to “why” you 
				probably don’t want to do it yourself. (Also see the next question for a more detailed answer.)

				<h3 class="fontface">I know my business better than anyone else. Why can’t I sell my company myself?</h3> The fact that you know 
				your business better than anyone else is exactly the reason why you should not try to sell it yourself. 
				Selling a company is a complex and time-consuming process. Any time you have to spend working on selling 
				the company is time you can’t spend on running the company, keeping it healthy and in the best position for a sale. 
				Even the largest companies who have legal and accounting staffs engage experts in mergers and acquisitions when 
				it comes time to buy or sell because they recognize that managing a selling process takes very specialized skills 
				that are developed through experience.
				<P>
				In addition, it’s just plain difficult to negotiate on your own behalf, especially when you may have to continue, on some level, 
				a working relationship with the buyer after the sale. We can be the bad guys, getting you the best deal without leaving anyone 
				with hard feelings.

				<h3 class="fontface">What makes The Crowell Global better than other merger and acquisition companies?</h3> The Crowell Global is focused 
				and passionate about each transaction we are involved in. We offer the perfect balance between analytics and industry know-how, 
				always establish a deep understanding of our client’s particular situation and hopes/dreams/needs for the transaction.
				<P>
				In addition, our backgrounds make us different than other Crowell Global firms.

				<h3 class="fontface">
				What do your services cost?</h3> Short answer: Commitment fee + closing fee
				<P>Long answer: To get started, we’ll ask for a commitment fee, which enables us to begin working on your project.
				We’ve discovered that the commitment fee takes our personal need to make a living out of the equation. 
				Since we’ll then have money to cover our basic costs, we have no incentive to try to push a bad or even mediocre deal through. 
				We are free to focus solely on your best interests, and we feel a heck of a lot better about that.
				<P>
				The closing fee is the industry-standard compensation model and is based on a percentage of the total transaction value. 
				We don’t get paid the closing fee until you get paid for the transaction.
				<P>
				While this might sound like a lot, the reality is that the majority of the time we help you to more than cover our fees by getting 
				you a better deal than you would without our assistance.

				<h3 class="fontface">Can’t I save money by doing it myself?</h3> 
				You’ve no doubt heard the adage “penny-wise and pound-foolish” and 
				it’s a good one to keep in mind when hiring an advisor. Looking solely
				at the dollar amount may be shortsighted, if the value the advisor
				brings is greater than or equal to that number.
				<p>
				In some consulting projects, the value an advisor brings may be difficult to evaluate,
				but in a sales transaction it’s relatively easy. In our experience, 
				we always bring more value than our fee, generally in the form of a higher sale price.
				<p>
				We say “generally” because there are other ways to bring value. For example, 
				we estimate that we save business owners from having to deal with 80% or so of
				the distractions and time investment that they face by doing it alone. 
				If we enable the seller to get a higher price that just covers our fee or 
				doesn’t quite cover our fee, the value is still significant. If an owner
				can’t focus on keeping the business on track during the critical period 
				of trying to sell the business, the company suffers and sales price generally follows.

				<a name="6"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">How long is the typical transaction process?</h3> 
				There really isn’t a typical transaction, but generally a transaction – from initial 
				meeting to the closing – takes six to 12 months. Sometimes it happens sooner;
				sometimes unanticipated events (sudden market downturn, personal/family crisis, 
				change of heart, etc.) can delay the process beyond 12 months. If someone tells you
				less than that, they are likely giving you the best possible case scenario to get you
				engaged, or they don’t realize the scope of the work involved. We’ll always be straight
				with you, even if it means you walk away.
				<p>
				The biggest thing to keep in mind is patience. That is how you will get the best value for your company.

				<h3 class="fontface">My business isn’t in one of the industries you listed. Can you still assist me?</h3> 
				Knowing an industry is always an advantage, since different industries use different indicators 
				in arriving at a valuation and evaluating the health of a business.
				<P>
				That said, having the right advisor, regardless of industry, makes all the difference. 
				It’s always worth a phone call to us. If we don’t think we can effectively represent you, 
				we’ll let you know. If we know we could bring value, we’ll let you know that, too. 
				If that means we partner with others to make sure the right skills are at the table, 
				then that’s what we’ll do. In any case, we’ll never learn a new industry on your dime.

				<h3 class="fontface">Is it the right time to sell my business?</h3> 
				There are a number of questions you can ask yourself to help you determine if now is the right time: 
				Is the market favorable to selling my business now? Is my business in a strong position with positive trends,
				a reliable stream of revenue and/or new revenue stream opportunities? Am I personally ready to: a) 
				do the work of a transaction while still running the business, b) look at my business through the eyes of 
				a potential advisor, and c) actually part with the business?
				<p>
				These are just some of the factors to consider when selling a business. However, companies rarely meet the ideal 
				profile of “ready to sell” and yet, they sell. We can help you evaluate if the time is right for you to embark on 
				a sale or if by making a few changes to your business you can reap larger rewards.
				<P>
				<a href="#top">Back to top.</a>
				<P><img src="images/hr-white-long.jpg" border="0">
				<a name="9"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">What’s my business worth?</h3> 
				The direct answer – the one that company owners don’t like to hear – is “probably not as much as you think.” 
				Of course this isn’t always true, but it can be understandably difficult for an owner to separate the emotional 
				value from the real-world sales value of a business into which they’ve invested years.
				<P>
				There are generic formulas, which some owners and less-than-rigorous transaction advisors will use to arrive 
				at a valuation number. However, these formulas do not factor in any industry-specific indicators, 
				operational assets or problem areas, or robustness of the market for your particular type of company.
				 Determining a company’s valuation is a complex process, and no one can give you a legitimate number 
				 without doing significant research and analysis.
				<p>
				This is why we go through a thorough process to analyze the numbers, understand your company’s 
				operations, consider revenue trends and evaluate market activity. In short, we learn your business 
				inside and out so that the number we deliver to you is a legitimate and realistic valuation. For us, 
				this is really the “low” number, because regardless of the valuation, we will always work to earn you more.

				<P><img src="images/hr-white-long.jpg" border="0">
				<a name="10"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">What about confidentiality?</h3> All prospective buyers sign a Nondisclosure 
				Agreement (NDA) with us before we communicate any specifics with them or allow them to see any 
				documentation other than a “blind document,” i.e. a general document that does not disclose specific
				information about your company. In addition, we do not communicate with anyone in your company without
				your specific approval. Discretion is as critical to us as it is to you. Safeguarding your proprietary 
				information is a fundamental part of doing business for us.

				<a name="11"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">I don’t want to upset my employees – how is the transaction handled so their concerns are mitigated?</h3> 
				Two things: First, we will not reveal anything regarding your sales transaction to anyone else in your company unless specifically
				instructed by you to do so. Second, we will work with you to develop a strategy for communicating the company’s sale to your 
				employees and a strategy for protecting the interests of your companies employees after a sale.

				<P><img src="images/hr-white-long.jpg" border="0">
				<a name="12"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">What kinds of advisors are required to do a transaction?</h3> 
				A sales transaction requires specialized skills not commonly found within companies.
				Even large companies with many resources still hire investment bankers or transaction advisors to do these deals.
				<P>
				A good transaction team will include: an accountant, an attorney and a transaction advisor.
				We work collaboratively with your company’s accounting and legal representatives to insure the transaction is 
				properly documented and that it is structured to maximize tax advantages.

				<a name="13"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">How do I transition my business once I sell it?  
				</h3> The transition period can be as short as a few months or as long as several years, 
				depending on the needs of both buyer and seller. We listen to our client’s desires and 
				goals and then work that into the fabric of the transaction. The key to a successful transition 
				is to leave a successful business to the buyers. Sometimes this means the seller remains with 
				the company in a different capacity – perhaps as a manager or advisor – for a period of time. 
				Other times, it may be a relatively simple transfer of physical property.

				<a href="#top">Back to top.</a>
				<P><img src="images/hr-white-long.jpg" border="0">
				<a name="14"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">Everyone talks about “strategic partnerships.” What does that mean? </h3> 
				Sometimes growing your business requires outside resources. This could be an investor who brings 
				new capital to your business, a foreign distribution partner or maybe a commercial partner with 
				the resources to complete the development and launch of your product. All of these scenarios, 
				and many others, require a process to find this partner. We lead and manage all of these types of processes.

				<a name="15"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">
				I don’t feel ready to make a change quite yet. When should I start working on a transition?</h3> The short answer: now.
				<p>
				The long answer: now. In all seriousness, the best time to begin working on a sales strategy is well before 
				you actually want to sell. We suggest that you start at least one to two years in advance.
				<p>
				We frequently do assessment projects where we look at all facets of the business and compare that against 
				what buyers are looking for in the market. We then work with you to figure out how to maximize the value 
				of your business, providing a roadmap of sorts. Preparation is key to maximizing value.

				<a name="16"></a>
				<h3 class="fontface">It sounds like you mostly represent the seller. Can you help me find a company to buy?</h3> 
				The reality is that we assist with both buying and selling, and because we understand the sale side, 
				we can bring that insight to your purchase process. In addition, we are constantly scanning the marketplace and
				networking with other advisors who deal with business owners, allowing us to know when opportunities arise.

				<h3 class="fontface">Who would I work with at The Crowell Global if I use you to sell or buy a company? </h3> 
				At The Crowell Global, you will work with only senior-level staff. And at least two principals will work on 
				your transaction, giving you greater breadth of expertise and the knowledge that you’ll always have our attention.
